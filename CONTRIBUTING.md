Please make sure to include the following in your bug reports:

 - error message, if any (included by default if you use the bug report links)
 - what you were doing (steps to recreate bug)

 - anything else you want to include

Feel free to bump your bug by commenting on it if it seems to be going nowhere for a long time.

**Warning when submitting bugs for unshared projects:** It is possible to download unshared projects using the project ID (included in most bug reports). Keep this in mind when submitting bug reports for these projects.

# Suggesting Features

Feature suggestions are welcome.

Please make sure to include the following:

 - what *exactly* are you looking for?
 - what problem does this solve?

# Pull Requests

Contributions are welcome. Builds steps are described in the README.

As long as your PR objectively improves forkphorus by doing something such as fixing a bug, it will probably be accepted.

Please try to keep the code style similar to what's already present and write tests if you can, but these trivial issues won't block a PR from being accepted.

## Writing tests

See https://github.com/forkphorus/forkphorus/tree/master/tests
